helping to keep you and your bike safe


## Motivation

Almost 85% of Berliner's own a bike. This project addresses the issue of safety of Berlin cyclists and their bikes.


## Product

The product contains 4 key elements:
- Locations - mapping of bike distribution in Berlin
- Accidents - mapping of bike accident distribution & hot spots 
- Thefts - bike theft data analysis & forecasting next day's bike theft number (RNN/LSTM model)
- Berlin bike tweets - lates tweets about bikes in Berlin

## Methods used

Machine Learning (DBSCAN cluster analysis of accidents in Berlin)
Data Analysis
Data Visualization (exploratory data analysis incl. mapping with plotly.express & folium) 
Predictive Modeling (forecasting next day's bike theft count in Berlin with time series RNN/LSTM model)
APIs (fetiching NextBike data for "Locations" part; obtaining latest bike tweets via Twitter API)
